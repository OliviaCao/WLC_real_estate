<h2>Welcome </h2>
	<p>WLC is a real estate business founded by Demin Wang, Wei Li and Ming Cao in 2005. They own several buildings as well as condominiums available for rent. The buildings include apartments, condominiums and townhouses. They are situated in both Quebec ( Canada ) and Tampa Bay ( United States of America )<br><br>

Demin Wang, Wei Li and Ming Cao live in Ottawa. They communicate with their Gatineau tennants through e-mails and phone calls and face to face encounters. Also, every week they drive up to Gatineau to evaluate the buildings and the tenants needs. They communicate with their american tennants through phone calls mostly. Even though they are not present to visit their american buildings every week, they hire another real estate agent to help them do so.<br><br>

This website includes all of real estate buildings WLC owns with a description of its location, rent availability, and rent information. For more information please contact us or visit our photo album for more pictures of the exterior and interior of WLC's buildings.</p>
